### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was a lab that had caught my interest when we were doing it as it was dealing with boolean statements. At the time, I was somewhat familiar with booleans but didn't have a full grasp on it. But after the lab I have a better understanding as to how they work by using the parking permits as examples.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was interesting to me because I had tended to over complicate my code at times, especially with vectors. However, with the help of the teacher assistants it taught me to simplify my code as it makes it easier for the computer and the user to read.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was one of my favorite labs as it had changed the way we code which was a challenge. As we were supposed to change our coding style from the procedural style that we had done the whole semester to an object oriented program that made the center of attention of our code around the objects of the code.
